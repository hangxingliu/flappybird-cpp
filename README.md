# Flappy Bird

Two simple FlappyBird demonstrations written in `C++`.
One demo use `SDL2`, and other one use `Qt`.

## flappybird-sdl

This demo is modified from my assignment of c++ lesson in my freshman year.

You can build it by scripts:

``` bash
./ci/setup-ci-env.sh # setup develop environment
mkdir flappybird-sdl/build;
cd flappybird-sdl/build;
cmake .. && make && ./flappy-bird; # make and run it
```

## flappybird-qt
